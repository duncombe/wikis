The DMAC integration testing project will assesses the maturity of DMAC implementation across IOOS Regional Associations and partner federal agencies.  The DMAC System Integration Test will:

1. Create test cases which incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines.  These test cases demonstrate that data consumers can use DMAC data discovery and access services to get IOOS data in a repeatable way.  This is considered the baseline. 
2. Apply these test cases to real world problems related to Extreme Events and Ecologically Sustainable Marine Energy Planning.
3. Compile a set of prioritized fixes and enhancements to DMAC data discovery and access services
4. Complete highest priority fixes and enhancements
5. Publish the test cases to encourage community education and involvement in IOOS
6. Demonstrate the added value of federal and non-federal data integration by IOOS data management to the ocean and coastal community
7. Ensure that we can repeat the assessment easily to measure progress over time
