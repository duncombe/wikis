The DMAC integration testing project will  assesses the maturity of DMAC implementation across IOOS Regional Associations and partner federal agencies.  The DMAC System Integration Test will:

1. Create test cases that demonstrate that data consumers can use the DMAC data discovery and access services to get data in a repeatable way.  This is considered the baseline. 
2. Apply these test cases to real world problems related to Extreme Events and Ecologically Sustainable Marine Energy Planning.
3. Compile a set of prioritized fixes and enhancements to DMAC data discovery and access services
4. Complete highest  priority fixes and enhancements
5. Publish the test cases to encourage community education and involvement in IOOS.
6. Ensure that we can repeat the assessment easily to measure progress over time
