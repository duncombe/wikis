Every three weeks we have a management review meeting to discuss progress.  This page contains the notes from those meetings in reverse chronological order.

Most of the discussion focused on creating a clear language description of the project.  The wiki homepage now contains a short set of objectives that serve this purpose.  Z may want to provide some edits and the wiki may change.

The following action items surfaced and JK has the action to move them to the issue tracker.

* Simplify schedule tracking by merging the two Gantt charts into the issue tracker using dated milestones.  See how this works for the time being.
* Create a plan for how we will solicit input from external stakeholders starting with the RA execs on Mar 4.  Basically we need to have a clear enough description of what we're doing and how the themes and test cases are generated so that we can ask them to help generate test cases.
