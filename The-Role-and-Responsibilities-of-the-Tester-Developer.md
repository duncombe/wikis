# DMAC Overview

The DMAC integration testing project will assesses the maturity of DMAC implementation across IOOS Regional Associations and partner federal agencies. The DMAC System Integration Test will:

1. Create test cases which incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines. These test cases demonstrate that data consumers can use DMAC data discovery and access services to get IOOS data in a repeatable way. This is considered the baseline.
2. Apply these test cases to real world problems related to Extreme Events and Ecologically Sustainable Marine Energy Planning.
3. Compile a set of prioritized fixes and enhancements to DMAC data discovery and access services
4. Complete highest priority fixes and enhancements
5. Publish the test cases to encourage community education and involvement in IOOS
6. Demonstrate the added value of federal and non-federal data integration by IOOS data management to the ocean and coastal community
7. Ensure that we can repeat the assessment easily to measure progress over time

The entire project is organized into phases or focus areas called themes. Themes will focus on a large problem area and will be used to identify common problems or needs commonly encountered by data consumers who work within these theme areas. These theme areas are similar to the GEOSS societal benefit areas.

# Core Processes of DMAC Testing
DMAC testing includes three core processes:

* Discovery: Surveying one or more data registries to ascertain what data are available in what format(s).
* Access:  Getting at some or all of discovered data across one or more repositories.
* Use:  Inputting accessed data into a known algorithm to determine if the algorithm can use the accessed data to generate meaningful, expected results.

# Dual Responsibilities
Because DMAC testing, while having some aspects of traditional system testing, is as much about discovery as it is about verification and validation.  You
