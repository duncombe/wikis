Proposed Policy Analysis Tasks for DMAC DATE Project:
TASK 1: Review and Provide Summary of Policy Documents, with focus on Data Integration Objectives in order to 1. Summarize Policy; 2. Identify Areas of Policy into which the IOOS Enterprise could fit
PPD-21 - Presidential Policy Directive -- Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resil)
PPD-21 takes a whole community approach [Determine if approach differs for coastal town, if approach focuses on data integration and whether it accommodates for data across jurisdictional boundaries - coastal boundaries, town boundaries, state waters, federal waters]
National Security Strategy (NSS)
Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8): National Preparedness
DHS Strategic Plan 2012-2016
DHS National Response Framework (NRF)
DHS Directive 8 (HSPD-8): National Preparedness Goal (NPG)
DHS Annual National Preparedness Report (NPR)
DHS/FEMA Crisis Response and Disaster Relilience 2030
White House National Strategy for Physical Protection of CIKR
National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security (GSCS)\
Stafford Act
National Response Framework
Economy Act
Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act
Oil Pollution Act
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (2007)
National Preparedness Report - 2012 
National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP)
2010 DHS Private Sector Preparedness Accreditation and Certification Program (PS-Prep), Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007
National Exercise Program (NEP) supported by interagency, 37 core capabilities
National Response Framework - 15 National Planning Scenarios [Query: should DATE project tie into one of these scenarios so as to create synergies with ongoing considerations? - Scenarios 9 and 10, earthquake and hurricane, would fit well if placed in coastal setting]
Daily Open Resource Infrastructure Reports (See, http://www.dhs.gov/dhs-daily-open-source-infrastructure-report) (determine if this kind of reporting system could be or is being utilized in order to report on ocean observing infrastructure?]
DHS CIP risk assessment program across private sector working through voluntary program - Infrastructure Survey Tool indexes and analyzes risk - goal is to create a practical dashboard tool that can compare index of security and resilience across facilities at local level and sectors at macro level to strengthen management skills

TASK 2: Review PPP policy in regards to disaster/resilience with focus on ocean and coastal data integration in the context of PPP Activity/Regional Assessment Activities in order to 1. Summarize Policy; 2. Identify whether and how data management and integration PPPs are currently part of resiliency policy

DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Infrastructure Protection - 16 infrastructure sectors, Protective Security Coordination Division
National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center - DHS
Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) see page 153 for details on the program - attempts to standardize how resiliency is evaluated across varioussectors and facilities.  RRAP is an interagency assessment of critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) combined with a regional analysis of the surrounding infrastructure - evaluates based on clusters and systems - participation is voluntary and information is protected under the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Program PCIIP [Determine if IOOS Data is part of simulations and which core variables, determine whether and how private data and information could be integrated into IOOS system or if it is already in a protected way…]
Formation of PPPs are highlighted in National Security Strategy, Presidential Policy Directive 8, and PPD-21, and National Response Framework [Determine if these partnerships highlight or emphasize data management or access - how do we incentivise the access of privately held/managed/formatted data in times of disaster without threatening proprietary value of the data? Rolling access? Limited Access? System of protected, event specific access?]
Ostrom/PPPs - role in homeland security - this could be extended to data commons.  Query: Could Ostrom’s approach to resources be applied to data or information tools? → Ostrom identifies a series of policies and rules that can be applied to common goods, including that there are clear boundaries, that users of property have to be able to monitor use and punish those who exploit it, and provide incentives to self regulate.
DHS CIP Databases - Infrastructure Information Partnerships - 
Appendix C identifies a series of database integration and systems improvement tasks within the Department of Homeland Security, Infrastructure Protection
Improvements are needed in the Automated Critical Asset Management System (http://dem.nv.gov/homeland_security/ACAMS_-_Automated_Critical_Asset_Management_System/)
“ACAMS is a secure, online database and database management platform that allows for the collection and management of CIKR asset data; the cataloguing, screening and sorting of this data; the production of tailored infrastructure reports; and the development of a variety of pre- and post-incident response plans useful to strategic and operational planners and tactical commanders”
This youtube explains the value of the platform in terms of protecting private information: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2rHOy7ebXY

TASK 3: Address identified legal and policy analysis in the context of ocean and coastal data integration
In Chapter 7, Egli identifies major findings which include the following needs for further analysis:
a comprehensive review of legislation and statutes relative to resilience policy [Driving query could be, does current law and statutes include data integration, management, and information access within the context of resiliency?  I.e. does the current framework addressing resiliency at multiple scales acknowledge the importance of access to information on a continuous basis so that at the time of the disaster, that information is ingrained in operations and available to responders?]
7.52: “a comprehensive decision support tool is needed to work across organizations and data boundaries. With the current processing tools, sought-after information is eventually found in the system, but the ability to collect, sort, and analyze infrastructure information in a systematic and automated manner is lacking.”
See also operational recommendations, p. 85, 8.15: “Devlop an analytically sound enterprise platform that provides CIKR and preparedness planners with an effective collaborative tool, leveraging data fusion and automated protocols to collect and process disparate time-critical data from homeland security information sources.”
7.53: “We need a systematic functional resilience framework that is scalable and can be generalized to various operational and geographic areas….”
7.56: “The private sector often views the flow of information as one way - from them to the government….is not motivated to share information due to 1. regulatory repercussions...the risk of proprietary information being exposed to market competitors.”
7.77: “the current approach to risk calculations being used by government and industry is flawed and works only if there are reliable data regarding threats, vulnerabilities and consequences.  Such data is seldom available and in some cases is impossible to acquire therefore, subjective information is often utilized to support decisions and grant proposals.”
7.92: “There should be more analytical rigor and quantitative information used in preparedness planning to reduce the amount of guesswork.  Everyone is surprised by natural disasters….FEMA research indicates that there are disaster cycles and geographic trends that can allow better preparedness decisions at the regional level”
CERTs - Community Emergency Response Teams - FEMA [Analysis could involve determining if the team can or should develop best practices, or whether there is an information officer role/training component in these scenarios which would serve to build information and community skill side of the emergency response]
TASK 4: Based on Tasks 1 - 3, develop approach for further outreach to GIS departments in states, partner with http://www.nsgic.org/ in order to conduct survey that would specifically target the topic of data integration and preparedness in regards to natural disasters
Egli’s Methodology included surveys, case studies, interviews of practitioners [NSGIC has engaged in state GIS surveys geared towards general information, DMAC ST could develop a targeted survey that would focus on ocean and coastal data - this might limit the number of states surveyed]
Egli relied on 
agency interviewees
open source public documents
private sector
subject matter experts (members of planning and operational staffs; representatives from private industry; members of academic community)

Notes on PPD-21
Policy:
“Three strategic imperatives shall drive the Federal approach to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience: 1) Refine and clarify functional relationships across the Federal Government to advance the national unity of effort to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience; 2) Enable effective information exchange by identifying baseline data and systems requirements for the Federal Government; and 3) Implement an integration and analysis function to inform planning and operations decisions regarding critical infrastructure.”
...2) Enable Efficient Information Exchange by Identifying Baseline Data and Systems Requirements for the Federal Government A secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure requires the efficient exchange of information, including intelligence, between all levels of governments and critical infrastructure owners and operators. This must facilitate the timely exchange of threat and vulnerability information as well as information that allows for the development of a situational awareness capability during incidents. The goal is to enable efficient information exchange through the identification of requirements for data and information formats and accessibility, system interoperability, and redundant systems and alternate capabilities should there be a disruption in the primary systems.
Greater information sharing within the government and with the private sector can and must be done while respecting privacy and civil liberties. Federal departments and agencies shall ensure that all existing privacy principles, policies, and procedures are implemented consistent with applicable law and policy and shall include senior agency officials for privacy in their efforts to govern and oversee information sharing properly.
….3) Identification of Baseline Data and Systems Requirements for the Federal Government to Enable Efficient Information Exchange. Within 180 days of the date of this directive, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the SSAs and other Federal departments and agencies, shall convene a team of experts to identify baseline data and systems requirements to enable the efficient exchange of information and intelligence relevant to strengthening the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. The experts should include representatives from those entities that routinely possess information important to critical infrastructure security and resilience; those that determine and manage information technology systems used to exchange information; and those responsible for the security of information being exchanged. Interoperability with critical infrastructure partners; identification of key data and the information requirements of key Federal, SLTT, and private sector entities; availability, accessibility, and formats of data; the ability to exchange various classifications of information; and the security of those systems to be used; and appropriate protections for individual privacy and civil liberties should be included in the analysis. The analysis should result in baseline requirements for sharing of data and interoperability of systems to enable the timely exchange of data and information to secure critical infrastructure and make it more resilient. The Secretary shall provide that analysis to the President through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.
