<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The strategy for DMAC integration testing is to package discrete test cases and their scripts within larger contexts called themes.  Each theme provides one or more scenarios that generates specific questions that require discovery, access and use of appropriate metadata and data.  The themes provide a realistic framework within which to frame and and address public policy questions with IOOS data.</p>
<p>Within each theme there is a top level problem statement, which contains the overall objective of the theme.  For a theme with more than more objective, two or more scenarios will address particular objectives within the theme.  Themes will be accompanied by IPython Notebooks which address particular questions under each theme.  Each IPython notebook will include comments that identify the theme for which the notebook is used, the question areas that the notebook addresses, the results from executing the python scripts, and the conclusions that can be drawn from the results.  A particular IPython notebook may address questions of discovery, questions of access and questions of use.</p>
<p>IPython notebooks will be standardized using the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theme Title</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Scenario Description and Title</strong><ul>
<li><em><strong>Questions</strong></em><ul>
<li>DISCOVERY Process (code and narrative)</li>
<li>ACCESS Process (code and narrative)</li>
<li>USE Process (code and narrative)</li>
<li><em><strong>Results and Conclusions</strong></em> (narrative)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedures will employ IPython scripts that interrogate DMAC registries and repositories, and analyze the returned data against expected results.  There is not necessarily a one-to one correspondence between a Question and a notebook product.  Each question may correspond to a number of notebooks in order to increase readability and modularity of the IPython notebook tools.   </p>
<p><a name="theme1"/></p>
<h1 id="theme-1-baseline-assessment">Theme 1: Baseline Assessment</h1>
<p>This is the elusive theme.  The logic and approaches used in this theme are inherent within all subsequent themes, and the techniques used for discovery, access and use are common to most, if not all scenarios.  This theme needs a very simple operational definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researcher Jane Doe is new to IOOS, and wants to find out what information is available for further research.  She decides to cast a broad net over all the IOOS registries to find out </p>
<ul>
<li>how much time series information is available on several common, core oceanographic variables:
<strong> wind speed and direction
</strong> wave height and duration
<strong> water temperature as measured at different depths
</strong> water salinity as measured at different depths
** the direction and speed of any current</li>
<li>where this information resides, and </li>
<li>whether this information can be used as input to a few of the most common data models.&lt; </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The baseline assessment theme includes test cases that, as the name of theme states, assess the basic functionality of the Data Management and Communications system.  While the test cases for this theme have no slant towards a particular scientific endeavor, the functionality to be tested underlies all subsequent test themes.  These test cases will incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines.   Results from this baseline assessment will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic statistics on the number and type of data sets in each chosen registry or catalog</li>
<li>The metadata standards and dialects employed within those registries</li>
<li>A determination if the amount of metadata is sufficient to use the data correctly</li>
<li>Statistics on the number of types of service protocols/endpoints to access the data</li>
<li>For a given area of interest list the total number of variables/data sets available in each catalog; list the variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information obtained through the use of IPython scripts will be compared against corresponding information retained by registry, catalog, or data repository owners to evaluate the success of the tests.</p>
<p>Baseline Python notebooks can be found <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ioos/system-test/tree/master/Theme_1_Baseline/">here.</a></p>
<h3 id="questions-to-guide-corresponding-ipython-notebooks">Questions to Guide Corresponding IPython Notebooks</h3>

<h2 id="scenario-2a-coastal-inundation">Scenario 2A: Coastal Inundation</h2>
<p>This scenario is nearing completion as of 11 July 2014.</p>

<p>As a severe storm is approaching the U.S. East Coast which will result in inundation, flooding, and wind damage over an extensive area. Coastal emergency managers must prepare for and respond to flooding as well as plan and implement evacuations.  Emergency managers, forecasters, and researchers currently rely on a number of data sources to do their work, including observations and forecast models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecasters are interested to know how federal and non-federal models compare to observed waves, river flows, and water levels, throughout the storm.</li>
<li>Coastal emergency managers use inundation and flood data to identify where first responders should dedicate resources. </li>
<li>After the storm, researchers want to compare observed data to modeled data to identify model shortcomings and areas of improvement, as well as to quality control observing systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to quickly and easily integrate these complementary datasets and predictions into visualizations and analyses will help emergency managers and responders improve their ability to forecast, prepare for and respond to coastal storms.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-2b-u-s-integrated-coastal-flooding-information-system">Scenario 2B:  U.S. Integrated Coastal Flooding Information System</h2>
<p>This scenario has not been touched as of July 11, 2014.  Unless there is a compelling case to be made for this scenario, it should not be pursued.</p>
<h5 id="northeast-or-east-coast-integrated-coastal-flooding-information-system-product-description">Northeast (or East Coast) Integrated Coastal Flooding Information System Product Description</h5>
<p>The northeast coastal zone (or eastern seaboard) is subject to significant coastal storms such as hurricanes and nor’easters, which can result in significant damage to property and loss of life. Much of the impact from these storms is a result of coastal flooding and erosion. </p>
<p>NWS forecasters are responsible for forecasting coastal hazards and issuing coastal warnings. Coastal emergency managers must prepare for and respond to flooding as well as plan and implement evacuations. Forecasters and emergency managers often rely on various and disparate data sources to perform there work. Some of the critical data sources used include observations from coastal water level monitoring stations as well as forecasted water level from a variety of models. Local observations of impacts and coastal land elevation data are also important data sources. Integrating these complementary data sets and predictions into a set of tools and displays that effectively delivers information to forecasters and emergency managers and responders could significantly improve their ability to forecast, prepare for and respond to coastal storms.</p>
<h5 id="user-community-addressed">User Community Addressed</h5>
<p>The primary user communities for this product are NWS marine forecasters, coastal emergency managers and responders and coastal resource managers. Additional stakeholders include coastal municipal officials and coastal property owners.</p>
<h5 id="questions-to-guide-corresponding-ipython-notebooks">Questions to Guide Corresponding IPython Notebooks</h5>
<p>This product will integrate critical coastal water level information from water level monitoring stations and various forecasts into a set of interactive visual tools. The displays will include both spatial and temporal display of observed and predicted water level and potential flooding.  The tools will allow the user to view one or more forecasts of water level and view what the predicted surge could be. Specific functional requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map displays of locations and/or regions that includes information about current water level and potential for flooding</li>
<li>Presentation of observed, predicted, surge water height on an interactive graph</li>
<li>Ability to set start and end dates of graphs</li>
<li>Water level displays allow user to select among various datums (e.g. NAVD88, MLLW) and units (e.g. cm, inches)</li>
<li>Water level display integrates local information about flooding if available</li>
<li>When available allow user to view multiple forecasts of water level from different models</li>
<li>Include a calculation of “consensus” prediction from various models</li>
<li>Ability to look at data from past events</li>
<li>Display street level flooding predictions in a map view where elevation and high resolution predictions are available</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="impact">Impact</h5>
<p>This integrated information product potentially has high impact because it will integrate critical observations and predictions into a tool that will allow NWS marine forecasters to view multiple predictions ultimately giving them more confidence and improved ability to predict coastal hazards. It will also give emergency managers and responders coastal water level information they need to more effectively prepare and respond to a coastal storm.</p>
<h5 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h5>
<p>This product is highly feasible because many of the required elements currently exist but need to be integrated. There are real-time water level monitoring stations and various water level prediction models operating in the region. There are also data standards/services in place or available that would allow standardized access to observations and forecasts. Additionally, much of the functionality desired for this integrated product already exists in various products (see listing below) and could be enhanced and brought together into an integrated tool. </p>

<h1 id="theme-3-species-protection-marine-habitat-conservation">Theme 3: Species Protection &amp; Marine Habitat Conservation</h1>
<p>The mission of the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service is to safeguard the viability of key marine species within the US economic zone.  That mission includes conserving sensitive marine habitat and restoring marine habitat that has been degraded by factors such as destructive fishing techniques and water pollution.  It also includes monitoring and protecting threatened marine species such as sea turtles and whales. The National Marine Fisheries service includes IOOS data in their assessments of habitat and threatened marine species.  Part of the value of integrating species and habitat data into the IOOS system is enabling the resolution of conflicts between human uses of our oceans and the protection of fragile marine habitats and the natural resources that they support.  Activities such as mineral extraction and energy siting require the use of a suite of marine habitat and species data in order to ensure that operations comply with marine conservation laws designed to require managers and policy makers to consider the ecological impacts of human activities.  </p>

<h3 id="scenario-3a-identifying-factors-affecting-species-viability">Scenario 3A: Identifying Factors Affecting Species Viability</h3>
<p>As of July 11, 2014, the Bering Seabird version of this scenario has been taken about as far as it can reasonably go. Python notebooks should be submitted for pull requests ASAP.  Much of the code can and should be re-used to assess the viability of species in other areas where human activities might cause harm.  Such scenarios might include tuna viability in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon spill, or Oyster viability in the Chesapeake Bay.Corresponding Python notebook can be found <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ioos/system-test/tree/master/Theme_3_Species_Protection_and_Marine_Habitat_Conservation/Scenario_3A_Assessing_Seabird_Vulnerability_in_the_Bering_Sea/">here.</a></p>
<p>The climate is changing in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region. Residents, stakeholders, scientists, and natural resource managers are all concerned about the impacts of future climate change on important species, systems and habitats. But projections of future climate are uncertain, and different approaches have different strengths and limitations. With variation in projections, and with different impacts depending on species and systems of concern, how can stakeholders and managers realistically anticipate and plan for the impacts of climate change?</p>
<p>Over the past months, an interdisciplinary team of scientists has begun an effort to assess the vulnerability of  key resources and ecosystem services including marine mammals, fish and commercial fisheries, terrestrial vegetation, human community sustainability and seabirds. Vulnerability assessment is a well-developed, systematic way to “synthesize and integrate scientific information, quantitative analyses, and expert-derived information in order to determine the degree to which specific resources, ecosystems, or other features of interest are susceptible to the effects of climate change” (USFS 2011). The Aleutian and Bering Climate Vulnerability Assessment (ABCVA) proposed to integrate model projections from two recent climate downscaling approaches; one from the Bering Sea Project, and one from the Spatial Tools for Arctic Mapping and Planning (STAMP). Both of these model outputs were ingested into the AOOS data system and results were shared with a team of 30 leading researchers and managers at the recent Alaska Marine Science Symposium in January. Since then, volunteer teams of expert working groups have begun to develop preliminary vulnerability assessment.  Teams have identified specific information gaps and questions of greatest relevance to resource managers and other stakeholders in the region relative to projected changes in climate. </p>
<p>One team, focused on seabirds, has identified the need for an analytical process that would allow the the exploration of multiple climate projection data sets.  This analytical process, described below, provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate the DMAC system integration capabilities within an existing project with Federal and non-Federal partners and Regional Associations. This project is a collaboration between the Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ABSI LCC), the Alaska Climate Science Center and the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS). It represents approximately a $150,000 investment, contributed in-kind staff time from the three organizations leading the effort, as well as substantial investments of in-kind investments from the 30 members that make up our 5 focal teams.
The seabird team, which includes collaborators from Audubon Alaska and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, has identified the need for a change detection analysis using 13 projected climate, and climate-derived, raster data layers within the boundaries of Audubon’s recently established  Important Bird Areas (IBAs). Important Bird Areas are zones of high biological productivity and conservation priority for marine bird species extend throughout the Pacific Flyway up the coast of North America, from Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, through the Bering Sea and into the Arctic Ocean (Smith et al. 2014). Almost 80% of the breeding seabirds within the U.S. are dependent on the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands making IBAs within our study region especially important.  This process will enable access to complex model outputs, and will create new pathways to discover and explore a broad suite of projected model variables that impact seabirds. Pairing this change detection analysis with expert knowledge on seabird ecology will strengthen the ability of managers to proactively plan for seabird monitoring and conservation. </p>
<p>Opportunities to replicate and adapt the workflow processes established by the IOOS System Integration Test could include any other regions where user-defined polygons and IOOS held model projects can be used to define statistical reports for IOOS resources using open-source computing resources. Other examples include using a very similar process to explore the projection space with IBAs in California using the same types of models, or marine mammal distribution areas and how they relate to projections of food sources (e.g., foraging areas associated with rookeries for northern fur seals and Steller sea lions have similarly been identified by NOAA managers). The proposed IPython Notebooks could also be used to explore projected changes in the marine ecosystem and how they relate to Essential Fish Habitat maps.</p>

<p>No development on this scenario as of July 11, 2014.  While interesting, this scenario is not feasible for development within the next 45 days.</p>
<p>The Cold Pool is a distinctive, along-shelf band of remnant winter bottom water over the mid and outer continental shelf particular to the area between the Northeast Peak of Georges Bank and Cape Hatteras. The Cold Pool is defined by its low temperature, and develops after the water column stratifies due to increased solar insolation, local fresh water runoff, and reduced wind mixing in April and May each year. Because the Cold Pool is bottom-trapped, it is virtually undetectable by ocean surface remote sensing measurements. Thus, existing pictures of Cold Pool distribution are aliased, incomplete, and one of the most poorly understood major Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB) features. The dynamics of this water mass has a disproportionately large role in structuring the biogeochemistry and ecology of the Mid-Atlantic continental shelf. For example the Cold Pool provides a thermal refuge for important fish species. This water mass also influences tropical storm and hurricane intensity.  </p>

<p>No development on this scenario as of July 11, 2014. Is development of this scenario feasible within the next 45 days?
The Department of Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is considering opening several tracts in the Gulf of Mexico for petroleum exploration. As part of their due diligence under regulations implementing the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Bureau must prepare an environmental impact statement before opening the tract to bids. The environmental impact statement must consider the potential impact of exploration and drilling on area fisheries.</p>

<p>As of July 11, Derrick to provide registry information to Kyle, who will finish the associated Notebooks.  Kyle estimates 8 hours of development time.</p>
<p>Python notebooks for this scenario can be found <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ioos/system-test/tree/master/Theme_3_Species_Protection_and_Marine_Habitat_Conservation/Scenario_3H_Exploring_Environmental_Changes_Affecting_Polar_Bears/">here.</a>
Polar bears were the first vertebrate species to be listed by the U.S. Endangered Species Act as threatened by extinction primarily because of climate change. Polar bears use persistent sea ice as a platform from which to hunt seals. However, as Arctic sea ice recedes, they have to swim further from shore to reach it and, ultimately, have a shorter hunting season. Additionally, the new sea ice edge may lie over unproductive waters.</p>

<p>The the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 3, <a href="http://www.ogcnetwork.net/pub/ogcnetwork/GEOSS/AIP3/documents/AIP-3_Use_Cases_ER110210.pdf">Use Case Engineering Report</a> provides a set of use cases that are relevant to DMAC and distributed data networks in general but are not science focused.   They may be useful as templates for building procedures for various DMAC test cases.  These so called transverse use cases may be useful in helping us standardize the data we will collect from each test case. [Note that the term &quot;transverse use case&#39; is not defined in systems testing literature and seems to be particular to the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot project.]   </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nota Bene: The structure and style of the GEOSS use cases should not be lifted and used without revision in DMAC testing. Rather, the GEOSS use cases can suggest procedures that can be easily adapted to test DMAC functionality.  Of particular interest to DMAC are three GEOSS general use cases:</p>
