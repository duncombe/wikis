##  What is IOOS?

The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is a federal, regional, private sector, and academic partnership that tracks, predicts, manages, and adapts to changes in our marine environments. The Data Management and Communications (DMAC) project of IOOS strives to deliver real-time, delayed-mode, and historical data from physical, chemical and biological data. Those data may be stored in repositories or come directly from sensors operated by academic, state, regional and federal members of IOOS.  The DMAC project has three objectives:
Standardize data structure and syntax across sensors and repositories to make data discovery and retrieval easier for researchers and policy makers.
Enhance open source search and retrieval software to provide a library of tools that have been tested and proven to work in discovering and retrieving IOOS data.
Improve the accessibility of IOOS data to multiple scientific disciplines, including, but not limited to, oceanography, meteorology, marine biology and climatology.

## What is the DMAC System Integration Test?

The DMAC system integration test  (SIT) will evaluate whether the IOOS services that have been deployed (i.e. SOS, OPeNDAP, WMS, CS/W) to Federal partners and Regional Associations can solve real world problems.

The DMAC test team is currently in the process of developing scientific and policy-oriented themes to assess the ease with which researchers can discover where relevant information resides, access that information and use it to address scientific and policy questions.  Our objectives are:

* To determine the current status of information discovery, access and use
* To implement fixes to issues that compromise information discovery, access and use in the short term
* To recommend long term enhancements

## How Does This Concern You?

If you are reading this, you play a role in an organization that capture, compile, store, organize and disseminate IOOS information.  It is likely that your organization owns and operates at least one repository of IOOS-related data.  It is likely that your organization is participating in the effort to catalog your IOOS-related data and make it available to registries that advertise it to researchers and policy makers.  For DMAC testing to succeed, it is essential for IOOS member organizations to assist us in ensuring that the test team knows what types of information are available for use, how the information can be reliably accessed, and where and how your organization's cataloged data are advertised.  Members of the DMAC test team are currently constructing procedures and assembling supporting client applications to perform their assessments.  However, the DMAC test team does not have the breadth or depth of expertise to construct test themes that accurately reflect the types of questions that researchers and policy makers might ask, and the types of data that they might research to answer their questions. You can help by assisting the DMAC tst team in writing two major test themes:
* Scientific and policy research concerned with extreme weather or climate-related events such as coastal inundation caused by a cyclonic storm
* Research involving marine ecosystems and how they are affected by such factors as invasive species, human-caused events like major oil spills, or changes in water quality caused by hypertrophication

If you or someone in your organization who has an interest in the success of IOOS can assist us in fleshing out the above testing themes, please contact Derrick Snowden at 301-427-2464 or at derrick.snowden@noaa.gov.
