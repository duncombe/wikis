# Introduction

* Highest level construct is a Theme and/or Scenario
  * TODO: Look at the GEOSS definition of scenario and see if it is similar enough to our needs that we can just use it.
* Second is Use Case ?
  * These are high level descriptions of functionality that aren't specific to a topic area or need.  Search, Access, Visualize etc.
* Third is Test Case ?
  * This is a specific example of a use case within a Scenario.  (e.g. a type of plot or a specific query against a specific metadata registry)

# Theme 1: Baseline Assessment
Use Cases are taken from the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 3, [Use Case Engineering Report](http://www.ogcnetwork.net/pub/ogcnetwork/GEOSS/AIP3/documents/AIP-3_Use_Cases_ER110210.pdf).
Editors note: we will note be testing or deploying any push technologies so Alerts are out of scope for DMAC and for this project.

## Use Case: Search for Resources
What are the essential elements that dictate whether a search was successful or not?

* List the interfaces that a catalog provides (html page with forms, csw, opensearch, ckan etc)

# Theme 2: Extreme Events 

## Use Case: Search for Resources 
Steps for portals and application clients to support the GEOSS User in searching for resources of interest via Community Catalogs and Registries

## Use Case: Present Services

## Use Case: Exploit Data Visually and Analytically

# Theme 3:  TBD (Considering Ecosystem, Water Quality, Biology, Climate Change, CMSP)
As a starting point for thinking about energy siting within CMSP as a potential third theme, here's a short [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8p4sUXIeKn1WVFhaGo0UzBnWjQ/edit?usp=sharing) emphasizing that the driver behind many state based CMSP has been the siting of energy.

The [InVEST Model for Wind Energy Siting](http://ncp-dev.stanford.edu/~dataportal/invest-releases/documentation/current_release/wind_energy.html#required-inputs) might be a good place to gather required data sets (See, "Required input" section in the link).  Looking through, however, I might argue that it could be additionally useful to add data sets required for permitting (e.g. migratory birds, marine mammals, fish abundance/species).


# Scenarios for consideration in the integrated DATE and Systems Integration Test activities (DMAC-ST Input)
