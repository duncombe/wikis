# Introduction

* Highest level construct is a Theme and/or Scenario
  * TODO: Look at the GEOSS definition of scenario and see if it is similar enough to our needs that we can just use it.
* Second is Use Case ?
  * These are high level descriptions of functionality that aren't specific to a topic area or need.  Search, Access, Visualize etc.
* Third is Test Case ?
  * This is a specific example of a use case within a Scenario.  (e.g. a type of plot or a specific query against a specific metadata registry)

# Theme 1: Baseline Assessment

# Theme 2: Extreme Events 
Use Cases are taken from the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 3, [Use Case Engineering Report](http://www.ogcnetwork.net/pub/ogcnetwork/GEOSS/AIP3/documents/AIP-3_Use_Cases_ER110210.pdf).
Editors note: we will note be testing or deploying any push technologies so Alerts are out of scope for DMAC and for this project.

## Use Case: Search for Resources 
Steps for portals and application clients to support the GEOSS User in searching for resources of interest via Community Catalogs and Registries

## Use Case: Present Services

## Use Case: Exploit Data Visually and Analytically
