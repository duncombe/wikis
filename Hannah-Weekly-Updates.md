# Week 1
I met with Derrick, went over data structures and the larger systems integration test, and set up an office space at IOOS as well as a connection to the shared drive.  I worked independently on familiarizing myself with the Wakari environment and the workflow of the office.  I gathered CMSP materials and literature to discuss a possible scenario involving oil spill/energy siting in order to flesh out a theme.  I completed 30% of an online Python tutorial to familiarize myself with the language used to call and examine data registries.
  
# Week 2
I continued to review the full sweet of systems integration documentation and worked on creating a notebook within the wakari environment. I successfully created a sample notebook using climate data and a sample csv file in order to familiarize myself with the notebook environment.  I summarized my past work on CMSP within the Wiki environment for the systems integration test and linked to documentation that could inform the team on ways to frame the scenario in terms of data layers.  I familiarized myself with the OSWLibrary and the language required for specific types of commands used for registries and the services that these registries provide (Web Mapping Services, etc.).  Due to a snowstorm, I was unable to meet with Derrick.

# Week 3
I drafted a baseline theme notebook that runs through a series of elements for each data registry and developed the language needed to test a web mapped services.  This will provide a ground level means and processes for testing particular data layers required during a test scenario.  I presented the notebook during my weekly meeting with the IOOS office, and got valuable feedback on how to structure the notebook and next steps in terms of how to handle the output of each notebook so that the information is presentable to a wider audience.  During the meeting, we also clarified next steps for finalizing a scenario and creating corresponding notebooks and outputs.  It was decided that rather than create standalone notebooks, it would be valuable to create bundles with notebooks and output files so that these could be gathered into a report at the completion of the project.

I made some progress on the master notebook, and just wanted to share that. I'm basically working through gathering different types of portals from the OWSLib and going through what can be looked at for each type, keeping a list at the top that is hashed, and coming up with some simple loops that will feed out the results. Here's the notebook so far:  [Testing Catalog Interfaces](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/hdean/Testing%20Catalog%20Interfaces). 

# Week 4

This week I continued to work on the IPython Baseline notebook, including calling of services from particular registries and determining the best way to develop metrics for testing registries in the context of the particular Themes outlined for the Project.

I also worked on articulating the third theme focused on marine planning/energy siting.  To that end, I developed a visualization approach to mapping data sets to regulations/laws/policy documents that aims to tie the need and use of particular data sets to specific directives at the legislative and executive levels.  Utilizing Lucidcharts, I put together a few [sample diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/41ba-1ae4-530cf34b-ba4d-50540a00c050) that aim to draw a clearer line between policy and data.  These visuals would provide a starting point for a set of notebooks aimed at testing registries and determining if the planning objectives are possible given the current resources.

I met with Derrick on Friday to discuss next steps in terms of summarizing the approach for Theme 3, determining approaches to quantifying outputs of the IPython notebooks, and approaching how to organize and quantify outputs from the collection of IPython notebooks that have been developed for the project so far.

# Week 5
This week I attended the Regional IOOS Directors meeting which was valuable both in terms of understanding modeling and data perspectives from the regional viewpoint, and in terms of hearing a bit more from the regions about their priorities in terms of ocean and coastal planning (conflict resolution), as well as their particular approaches to managing their data.  In addition, the meeting resulted in gathering together documents that will help inform the direction that the themes go for the DATE project, and make sure to align the project with regional needs.

I also worked to catalogue existing iPython notebooks, and provide that catalogue online, which will serve to provide a resource both for the project and for the public by creating a one stop clear outline of current testing activities.  I met with Derrick to talk about next steps, and determined that the final theme needs to be reworked over the next week.  We also developed a preliminary approach to standardizing and editing iPython notebooks so that they can serve as a more polished product in terms of the outcomes of the project.
