The following notes are from Hannah Dean, and were originally written as presenter's notes for the March 2014 RA Directors briefing.  There were a bit too detailed for that setting, but should be preserved for reference, so they have been copied here.

Questions for Theme 3: Marine Energy Planning
1. What data is needed for particular energy planning policies (Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, National Environmental Policy Act, etc)?
2. Can that data be easily accessed from the set of registries and catalogues that the IOOS Systems Test is examining?  If so, which registries can each dataset be accessed through?  And, using baseline metrics developed under Theme 1 for registries, are there certain registries that are better or worse for accessing particular data sets?

Example:
A. Specific Questions using OCSLA as a starting point:
1. Can we plot bottom character/bathymetry against historical primary productivity (chlorophyll a, gC.m^2/year, phytoplankton abundance and species, zooplankton abundance and species) for a particular planning area (e.g. Gulf of Mexico) as might be required in the context of planning for mineral extraction under the OCSLA and corresponding policy?
2. Can we plot jurisdictional boundaries (fisheries management, leasing blocks, marine sanctuaries, marine protected areas, etc.) against data sets for the IOOS core variables, and in particular data sets that might be used to estimate primary productivity (chlorophyll a, gC.m^2/year, phytoplankton abundance and species, zooplankton abundance and species)?

B. Projected outcomes:
1. For each question listed under part A, the IPython notebooks would result in a set of metrics for each registry assessing whether or not the plot could be completed
2. Aggregating the notebooks developed for this example would result in a summary of those registries where metadata, particular variables, or particular formats make it hard to overlay and integrate information needed to meeting the planning objectives of the particular policy
