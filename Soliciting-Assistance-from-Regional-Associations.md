## Objective  
Persuade directors of Regional Associations to allocate subject matter expertise to assist the DMAC test team in constructing and executing test themes.

## Background
The Regional Associations are the core of IOOS, and in some cases have expended significant effort to makes their servers available to IOOS-approved clients for data discovery, access and use.  The DMAC test is a way for the RAs to ascertain how successful they have been in their efforts.  

## Needs
DMAC test team needs assistance in developing test cases for two major themes:
* Extreme Events
* Marine Ecosystem (or some related name to be refined)

TODO: There are two roles that are conflated here.  1. a subject matter expert knowledgeable about the themes (extreme events) and the data they need to answer questions 2. Data managers who know how to take the underlying data and publish according to the standards we are advocating.  The first group helps us come up with the questions, the second helps us apply technology solutions.

Each RA includes one or more subject matter experts who may be considered to be Data Conservators. These SMEs know what data their association collects, how those data are stored, the format in which those data are stored, the format of the metadata that describes them and the data stored in associated repositories, and the most common types of queries made against their data and metadata.  These conservators likely have a set of query tools that they use to perform discovery, access and use related to particular scientific and/or policy areas.  What we need:

* Copies of any scripts or tools that they currently use for discovery, access, and use
* Some background information on the scripts, as well as some instruction on how to configure and use them
* Estimate needing 4-8 hours of time from each SME.


## Resources
Regional Associations who have configured their data access services to function within the DMAC model should have a vested interest in helping the DMAC system test achieve its objectives.  Regional Associations have subject matter experts either on staff or closely affiliated. 

## Obstacles
SMEs cannot be paid for their efforts.  Their contributions must be voluntary.
Opportunity for persuading Regional Directors is small.  Not much time available during the meeting.

## Elements of Approach
* Summarize DMAC scope in a few sentences, emphasizing focus on testing themes.
* Highlight some current elements of the themes, along with results of test case Python scripts.  Use Rich's and Hannah's work to date to illustrate our current development efforts. Use 3-5 slides to do this.  Slide content should skew strongly towards graphic content over verbal content.
* Ask for SME assistance in fine tuning the themes.  Use listing of some of the test theme brainstorm items as teasers.
* Press the Regional Directors for names and contact information of SMEs.
* Contact the SMEs directly.  Talk to them and use desktop sharing to illustrate what we are doing and what kinds of assistance we need.
* Closing emphasis:  Not much to ask to help insure that the RAs efforts to configure data registries and data catalogs have been successful.
