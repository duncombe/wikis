## Objective:  Persuade directors of Regional Associations to allocate subject matter expertise to assist the DMAC test team in constructing and executing test themes.

## Need
DMAC test team needs assistance in developing test cases for two major themes:
* Extreme Events
* Marine Ecosystem

## Resources
Regional Associations who have configured their registries and catalogs to function within the DMAC model should have a vested interest in helping the DMAC system test achieve its objectives.  Regional Associations have subject matter experts either on staff or closely affiliated. 

## Obstacles
SMEs cannot be paid for their efforts.  Their contributions must be voluntary.
Opportunity for persuading Regional Directors is small.  Not much time available during the meeting.

## Elements of Approach
* Summarize DMAC scope in a few sentences, emphasizing focus on testing themes.
* Highlight some current elements of the themes, along with results of test case Python scripts.  Use Rich's and Hannah's work to date to illustrate our current development efforts. Use 3-5 slides to do this.  Slide content should skew strongly towards graphic content over verbal content.
* Ask for SME assistance in fine tuning the themes.  Use listing of some of the test theme brainstorm items as teasers.
* Press the Regional Directors for names and contact information of SMEs.
* Contact the SMEs directly.  Talk to them and use desktop sharing to illustrate what we are doing and what kinds of assistance we need.
