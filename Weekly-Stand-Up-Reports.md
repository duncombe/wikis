# Directions
Please use this page for a weekly stand-up report from each development team.  Once a week, preferably on Thursday, a person appointed by each team should access this page and post a short summary of the team's status. There is no need for lots of detail.  When in doubt, use fewer words.  The stand-ups will become a basis of the agendas of our bi-weekly teleconferences.
Please use the following format:
