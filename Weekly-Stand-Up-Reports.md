# Directions
Please use this page for a weekly stand-up report from each development team.  Once a week, preferably on Thursday, a person appointed by each team should access this page and post a short summary of the team's status. There is no need for lots of detail.  When in doubt, use fewer words.  The stand-ups will become a basis of the agendas of our bi-weekly teleconferences.
Please use the following format:
# Week of [Monday date of the work week]
## Stand-up for [ASA, Axiom, Name-of-independent contributor]
### Accomplishments, aka, What we've done in the past week
### Anticipated activities, aka, What we're planning to do in the coming week
### Issues,i.e., recurring issues that may span a number of individual issues reported in GitHub

# Week of 2 June 2014

## Stand-up for Axiom

#### Accomplishments
* Reworked the Scenario 3A goals and notebook to be as more general solution.  Starting with a polygon/bbox/wfs layer, we are now searching all catalogs for overlapping datasets.  This allows the polygon to represent any number of things.
* Moved to the new folder structure via: https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Project#creating-or-updating-notebooks

#### Anticipated Activities
* Finish Scenario 3A notebook

#### Issues
* The WFS server hosting the Important Bird Area polygon is not available in any CSW endpoint.

## Stand-up for ASA

#### Accomplishments
* Install iris on mac using condo
* Use iris to get model data.
* Plot modeled vs obs data in Scenario_A_Model_Obs_Compare_Waves.ipynb  (see pull request https://github.com/ioos/system-test/pull/89)
* Start new notebook for comparing model and obs currents

#### Anticipated Activities
* Implement sub directory structure discussed on 5/30 call
* Organize all notebooks in new sub directories
* Compare model and obs current speed/direction; try bounding boxes in different locations, e.g. near Puerto Rico
* Use Iris to get model data for comparison in Extreme Waves and Water Level notebooks
* Start notebook for extreme current values

#### Issues
* Installing Iris on mac - resolved
* Getting NDBC SOS current data for stations near Puerto Rico such as station 41051 (Still investigating whether this merits an actual issue in GitHub)
