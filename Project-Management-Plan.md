This document describes the procedures we'll adhere to in carrying out the project.  It is comprehensive in that it includes management of all relevant knowledge areas, with the exception of cost management. Areas addressed by this document include the following:
* Scope Management: Track Development of [Test Themes](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Development-of-Test-Themes)
* Time Management: Track [Milestones](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/issues/milestones)
* Quality Management: Track [System-Test Metrics](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/graphs)
* Communication Management: Track [Issues](../issues)
* Risk Management 
* Integration Management: Track List of [Services Registries and Data Catalogues](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Service-Registries-and-Data-Catalogs)

This document does not address procurement management, as there are no procurement actions planned for the project.


# Goals and Objectives

TBD taken from the document we worked on jointly.




# Scope

The scope of the test is divided among three categories:
  1.  Subject matter scope: [Test Themes](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Development-of-Test-Themes)
  2.  Data Content Scope: [Services Registries and Data Catalogues](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki/Service-Registries-and-Data-Catalogs) 
  3.  Technology Scope: [Custom Wakari Environments](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/tree/master/wakari)

* Using python clients exclusively (TODO: Provide a list of the packages and links to the conda.spec file that we'll use)
* *_Editors note: we will note be testing or deploying any push technologies so Alerts are out of scope for DMAC and for this project._*

List the mechanism we will use to decide if we fix a bug or defer it.

# Schedule
The current official end date for this project is approximately Sep 2014.  Tight timeline to fit it all in!!!

 * Track [Milestones](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/issues/milestones)
 * Track [Issues](../issues) to manage tasks
 * Use issue labels to identify priority (high medium, low) and functionality (registry, data provider, clients etc))
 * Use milestones to map tasks to dates.
 * Anyone may initiate issues and anyone may select to work on, or own an issue.  If an issue remains unassigned for too long Derrick will assign it.  
 * Derrick will brief management every three weeks and will summarize project status prior to these meetings.



# Documentation

##Documentation Process and Approach:
These wiki pages should serve as working documents that are updated as the project progresses.  Some material will be moved from the wiki to the project site as it matures.  The project site will consist of two types of material:  
  1.  Blog Environment with IPython Scripts and Results using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/)
    * Model: [Filipe Fernandes' blog](http://ocefpaf.github.io/blog/2013/12/23/blog/)      
  2.  [Project Page with Static Documentation](https://github.com/ioos/system-test/wiki)  

For the early part of the project we will concentrate on the IPython notebooks until we have a critical mass of material to begin summarizing.
