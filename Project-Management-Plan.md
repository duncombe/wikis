This page describes the procedures we'll adhere to in carrying out the project.

# Objectives and Scope

Develop a vision statement and supporting objectives.  For example, we need a general statement of what we're doing and why.  We also need a statement on how others can participate.  _Use this space to develop the material or link to it from here._



* Using python clients exclusively
* Phase 1 will include a scenario focused on a baseline assessment of the service registries and the client capabilities
* Phase 2 will elaborate on the baseline assessment and begin to focus more on the scientific themes/scenarios.
* At least one theme will focus on an extreme event such as severe storms or coastal inundation
* Remaining themes will be selected based on input from the project team or anyone else in the community. See [Scenario Brainstorming](Scenario-Brainstorming) for a list of potential scenarios. 

 

# Schedule
 * Use issues to manage tasks
 * Use milestones to map tasks to dates in the project plan (Microsoft Project document managed offline by John/Derrick).  Therefore, only Derrick or John will add new milestones.
 * Anyone may initiate issues and anyone may select to work on, or own an issue.  If an issue remains unassigned for too long Derrick will assign it.  
 * Use labels to map tasks to status (complete or not?), functionality (csw/sos/dap/plotting etc), components and scenarios
 * Derrick will brief management every three weeks and will summarize project status prior to these meetings.



# Documentation

These wiki pages should serve as working documents that are updated as the project progresses.  Some material will be moved from the wiki to the project site as it matures.
