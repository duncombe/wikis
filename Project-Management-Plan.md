This page describes the procedures we'll adhere to in carrying out the project.

# Schedule
 * Use issues to manage tasks
 * Use milestones to map tasks to dates in the project plan (Microsoft Project document managed offline by John/Derrick).  Therefore, only Derrick or John will add new milestones.
 * Anyone may initiate issues and anyone may select to work on, or own an issue.  If an issue remains unassigned for too long Derrick will assign it.  
 * Use labels to map tasks to status (complete or not?), functionality (csw/sos/dap/plotting etc), components and scenarios
 * Derrick will brief management every three weeks and will summarize project status prior to these meetings.
