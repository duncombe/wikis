###Step 1:
####Determine the Theme of your question:
*  Theme 1: Baseline Assessment
*  Theme 2: Extreme Events
*  Theme 3: Species Protection and Marine Habitat Conservation

###Step 2:
####Provide a short Descriptive Title for your Scenario

###Step 3:
####Summarize Scenario
Provide a short description of the Scenario (less than 500 words).  The description should set the stage and include the following information:
*  purpose and overview
*  stakeholder interest

###Step 4:
####Provide a set of questions to guide IPython Notebooks
These questions should essentially breakdown the kinds of data interoperability that might be required to meet scenario needs.  Questions should be kept simple and contained in scope (e.g. Can Model A be overlaid with X,Y,Z variables?  or What data sets are available via the IOOS System that could help describe the following variables: x,y,z?)

###Step 5:
####Provide a list of Data/Models/Variables that are required to answer the questions developed in Step 4.
