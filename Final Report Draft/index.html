        <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>The distributed, service oriented architecture of DMAC has been implemented independently by IOOS partners, using different software approaches and different levels of implementation.  IOOS partners differ in their online data discovery and access protocols they offer, the percent of their datasets available through their online services, and the percent of datasets registered with the IOOS catalog.  These differences can present difficulties to researchers and policy makers who are looking for oceanographic data to address important scientific endeavors and policy issues.</p>
<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>
<p>The DMAC System Integration Test (SIT) evaluates the extent to which the services that IOOS has deployed  to Federal partners and Regional Associations can assist researchers and policy makers in finding, accessing and using oceanographic data to address important research questions and policy issues.  IOOS services tested include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol (DAP) and/or Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Coverage Service (WCS) for access to gridded data</li>
<li>OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for access to in situ observations</li>
<li>OGC Web Map Service (WMS) for access to geo-referenced image data</li>
<li>OGC Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)</li>
</ul>
<p>The DMAC-IT varies from the common notion of system integration test in two important ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The DMAC architecture is not one system, but rather, a system of systems, each one operated by an IOOS partner, and each one largely outside of IOOS control. Therefore, the IOOS DMAC team cannot control the configuration of IOOS member data registries and repositories.  One consequence is that an IOOS member can make changes to their system that invalidate previous successful DMAC tests.  Therefore, the results of a particular DMAC-IT test for a particular IOOS partner site are reliable only so long as the configuration of the partner&#39;s data resources remains unchanged.  IOOS parnters frequently alter the configuration of their data resources without informing the IOOS program office. Although the DMAC-IT project has an end date, the process of testing whether an IOOS partner&#39;s data resources can be identified, accessed and used will be an ongoing operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The protocols the DMAC-IT has used to identify, access and use data are in varying states of maturity.  Some of them have been widely adopted by IOOS partners, while others are in the early stage of adoption.  Because the IOOS partners do not yet have a fully standardized set of protocols, a service that might work for 6 partner sites might not work for another 4.  In this context, success is defined as knowing which service protocols work for which IOOS partner sites.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The objective of the DMAC-IT is to assess the current level of maturity of DMAC, as measured by the the extent to which Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard query tools and techniques can successfully identify, access and use information from IOOS data providers.  </p>
<h1 id="testing-framework">Testing Framework</h1>
<p>The approach for DMAC-IT has been to package discrete test scenarios and their scripts within larger contexts called <em>themes</em>. Each theme provides one or more <em>scenarios</em> that generates specific questions that require discovery, access and use of appropriate metadata and data. The themes provide a realistic testing framework within which to frame and and address public policy questions with IOOS data.</p>
<p>Within each theme there is a top level <em>problem statement</em>, which contains the overall objective of the theme. For a theme with more than more objective, two or more scenarios will address particular objectives within the theme. Themes are accompanied by IPython Notebooks which address particular questions under each theme. Each IPython notebook includes comments that identify the theme for which the notebook is used, the question areas that the notebook addresses, the results from executing the python scripts, and the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. A particular IPython notebook may address questions of discovery, questions of access and questions of use.</p>
<p>IPython notebooks use the following common format:</p>
<p>Theme Title
Scenario Description and Title
Questions
DISCOVERY Process (code and narrative)
ACCESS Process (code and narrative)
USE Process (code, narrative, and graphics where appropriate)
Results and Conclusions (narrative)</p>
<p>The procedures employ IPython scripts that interrogate DMAC registries and repositories, and analyze the returned data against expected results. There is not necessarily a one-to one correspondence between a Question and a notebook product. Each question may correspond to a number of notebooks in order to increase readability and modularity of the IPython notebook tools.</p>
<h1 id="test-themes">Test Themes</h1>
<h2 id="theme-1-baseline-assessment">Theme 1: Baseline Assessment</h2>
<p>The baseline assessment theme includes test scenarios that, as the name of theme states, assess the basic functionality of DMAC.  While the test scenarios for this theme have no focus on a particular scientific endeavor, the functionality to be tested underlies all subsequent test themes. These scenarios incorporate multiple IOOS Regions and partners, cover a large geographic scope, employ multiple types of data, and cross scientific disciplines. Results from baseline scenarios include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic statistics on the number and type of data sets in each chosen registry or catalog</li>
<li>Metadata standards and dialects employed within those registries</li>
<li>Statistics on the number of types of service protocols/endpoints to access the data</li>
<li>For a given area of interest, a listing of the total number of variables/data sets available in a given catalog, as well as a listing of the variables in the catalog</li>
</ul>
<p>The following general questions have been used to guide the development of IPython notebooks within the Baseline Theme.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the essential elements that determine whether a search has been successful?</li>
<li>What are the interfaces that a particular catalog provides (html page with forms, csw, opensearch, ckan etc)?</li>
<li>What are the contents of a given registry when summarized along several important query parameters?</li>
<li>What variable names (IOOS core variables, CF standard names etc) appear within a given registry?</li>
<li>Which well-defined service interfaces are present for a given registry?</li>
<li>For a given registry, are clear, human-readable titles/abstracts/summaries/identifiers contained in the metadata?</li>
<li>Within a given registry are there present keywords and references to standardized keyword vocabularies (preferably machine readable)?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="guiding-questions">Guiding Questions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can we discover, access, and overlay Important Bird Area polygons (and therefore other similar layers for additional important resource areas) on modeled datasets in the Bering Sea?</li>
<li>Is metadata for projected climate data layers and Important Bird Area polygons sufficient to determine a subset of polygons desired by a query?</li>
<li>Can a simple set statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) be derived from multiple variables in each of the six models to derive the forecast variability of climate conditions through time, through the end of the model runs (2003-2040)?</li>
<li>Can we create a standardized matrix or other display method for output variables that allow resource experts to easily assess projected changes in climate variables, within given ranges of time, and compare projected changes across multiple coupled oceanographic and climate models?</li>
<li>Can we develop a set of process-specific guidelines and a standardized set of outputs for a tool that would allow researchers to address a diversity of resource management questions relative to projected changes in climate for specific zones of interest?</li>

<h1 id="conduct-of-the-test">Conduct of the Test</h1>
<p>Responsibility for developing, executing and refining tests was divided by scenario among the developers, with each scenario having a dedicated team to develop, execute and refine the Python Notebooks.  Two versions of each Notebook were developed:  one in Python, and one optimized to run in a iPython shell. GitHub was used to store and track testing information, including the Notebook code, supporting files like READ.ME and utilities, test documentation, and issues.  </p>
<h2 id="github-issues">GitHub Issues</h2>
<p>GitHub issues were used as a repository for all activities related to the development and execution of the test.
Every member of the DMAC SIT Team was empowered to initiate, comment on, assign, resolve and close GitHub issues.  Each GitHub issue was labeled for its priority, as well as which aspect of the test to which it related.  A listing of the GitHub labels appears below, and label descriptions are provided as needed:</p>
<p>MMI --issues dealing with the Python Model Message Interface (MMI)
bug -- Python Notebook execution issues not otherwise classified
client-issue -- issues related to Python client applications
data-provider-issue  -- issues dealing with identification, access or use of data from a data provider
documentation
duplicate
enhancement 
high priority
invalid
low priority
medium priority
progress -- summary test report on a Python Notebook (See Progress heading below)
project-management
question
registry-issue -- issues dealing with IOOS data regsitries
scenario-baseline
scenario-biology
scenario-brainstorming -- discussion of possible test scenarios
scenario-extremeevents
wakari -- discussion of issues related to the use of the Wakari suite of Python data analysis tools
wontfix -- issues that were not fixed during the DMAC SIT</p>
<h2 id="bi-weekly-stand-ups">Bi-Weekly Stand Ups</h2>
<p>Stand Up teleconferences were held an average of once every 2 weeks, at which each development and test team highlighted their accomplishments of the past two weeks, reviewed their development and test plans for the upcoming two weeks, and raised general issues for discussion.  Discussion issues focused mostly on good practices for Python coding, the use of Python utilities, repositories of oceanographic metadata and data for testing, and techniques for dealing with problems particular to the scientific analysis of oceanographic data.</p>
<h2 id="progress-issues">Progress Issues</h2>
<p>Testing teams summarized their efforts in GitHub Progress issues, with each Progress issue summarizing the results of a given test scenario. Information included in a Progress issue includes examples of successful use of IOOS data in data analysis tools, short term issues that were or can be easily resolved, and long term issues requiring further research and development.</p>
<h2 id="code-configuration-management">Code Configuration Management</h2>
<p>Because the DMAC SIT used GitHub as the code repository, standard GitHub workflow practices were used for code configuration management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each developer/tester forked a copy of the code repository and branched off that working copy to develop his or her own code</li>
<li>When a developer/tester was satisfied with the code in a particular branch, he or she pushed the code to his or er forked copy of the code repository and submmitted a Pull Request.</li>
<li>One of two designated System Administrators reviewed the code, reviewed the code for any obvious issues, and if no issues were identified, the System Administrator pulled the submitted code into the master code repository.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results-and-findings">Results and Findings</h1>
<p> A summary of DMAC SIT results follows, organized by test scenario.  Detailed results are found in the Progress issues on GitHub:  <a href="https://github.com/ioos/system-test/labels/progress">https://github.com/ioos/system-test/labels/progress</a>.</p>
<h2 id="baseline-assessment">Baseline Assessment</h2>
<h3 id="scenario-1-a-model-strings">Scenario 1 A:  Model Strings</h3>
<p>The test successfully queried many different CSW servers on a variety of model strings, and the Python Notebook was able to compile a summary of service types by model, service type, and source URL.  Several examples are illustrated below:</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13939/3861910/945a5b04-1f34-11e4-96ec-f7d7456638c3.png" alt="Number of Services by Type of Scema"></p>
<pre><code><span class="pln">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="typ">Number</span><span class="pln"> of services discovered </span><span class="kwd">by</span><span class="pln"> type of schema</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln"><br /></span></code></pre><h3 id="scenario-1b-core-variable-strings">Scenario 1B: Core Variable Strings</h3>
<p>The test successfully queried the Marine Metadata Interoperability (MMI) ontology for a list of IOOS Core Variables, was able to obtain Climate &amp; Forecast (CF) standard metadata named through MMI for all IOOS Parameter Vocabulary, and was able to successfully obtain CF Standard Names through MMI related to IOOS Parameter Vocabulary.  The test was also able to successfully search Catalog Service Web (CSW) servers on CF Standard names to get back a summary of offerings</p>
